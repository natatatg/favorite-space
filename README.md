This is my submission for the [YearOne Holiday Dev Challenge](https://joinyearone.notion.site/YearOne-Holiday-Dev-Challenge-bf60ff1f14d548a2a488d0b2327126e7). This app displays the 20 most recent Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA with a collapsible description/caption and ability to like images. 

### API Usage
This app makes use of the publicly available NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) [API](https://api.nasa.gov/).

### Future Development / Roadmap
Future plans for the application include developing the backend to track likes for each image (currently the number of likes is randomly generated for demonstration purposes), adding a random generator button to get a specified number of random images from the same API, and to add more styling to the UI.
